# Deterministic NetHack Algorithm

> The main file in this repository is [Agent.py](./Agent.py). Running this script will run the algorithm on a randomly generated dungeon and will print the game's state to the screen after each move taken by the agent. The algorithm will quit, when it either dies or reaches the staircase.

> The dependencies to install are matplotlib, nle and gym. These can all be installed with pip. This program must be run with python 3.5+ due to its use of some more recent python features.
